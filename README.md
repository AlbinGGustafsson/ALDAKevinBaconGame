The ALDAKevinBaconGame utilizes a graph structure built from a vast movie database to determine the shortest path between the actor Kevin Bacon and any other actor or movie within the database. It employs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Initially, the algorithm builds paths from a start node until it reaches the end node. It records the traversed nodes in a map called "visited," linking nodes to their preceding node. Subsequent searches check if the end node already exists in the "visited" map to skip the search and directly generate the path. If not found, a new search is conducted. This efficient strategy quickly determines the "Bacon number" or degrees of separation between Kevin Bacon and other entities in the film industry.
